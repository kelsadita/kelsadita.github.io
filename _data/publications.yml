  abstract: An educational institution needs to have an approximate prior knowledge of enrolled students to predict their performance in future academics. This helps them to identify promising students and also provides them an opportunity to pay attention to and improve those who would probably get lower grades. As a solution, we have developed a system which can predict the performance of students from their previous performances using concepts of data mining techniques under Classification. We have analyzed the data set containing information about students, such as gender, marks scored in the board examinations of classes X and XII, marks and rank in entrance examinations and results in first year of the previous batch of students. By applying the ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3) and C4.5 classification algorithms on this data, we have predicted the general and individual performance of freshly admitted students in future examinations.

  abstract: The emerging threats to user privacy over the internet are increasing at an alarming rate. Signingin from an unreliable terminal into a web account may result in compromising private details of a user such as username and password, by means of keylogger software. Such software are capable of recording keystrokes secretly, via covert channels without the knowledge of the user. In this paper we propose a secure method for signing in using Quick Response (QR) codes with mobile authentication. Through this method, the user can securely sign-in into a web account by authenticating the user session on an unreliable terminal browser, using a mobile device.

  abstract: Maximum flow problem is a fundamental network flow problem which involves finding a feasible and optimal flow in network consisting of single source and single sink. It has wide ranges of research and commercial applications. Many sequential algorithms such as Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, Edmonds-Karp algorithm, Goldberg’s “generic” maximum flow algorithm, ϵ-relaxation algorithm have been designed to solve this problem. In this paper, we present parallel implementation of ϵ-relaxation algorithm which has been carried out over a cluster consisting of 1 master and 4 slaves nodes in order to study and improve the efficiency of solving maximum flow problem on multi-computer architecture.
